    <h3>
        [1] MeToo Project: 
    </h3>
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em">
    Lead a team of ten researchers studying social media discourse and news coverage of #MeToo and the impact of diversity on the editorial and staff teams on news attention and framing. Study the discourses surrounding the #MeToo movement by people of color and global #MeToo discourse. Have used structural topic modeling followed by discourse analysis and social network analysis (SNA) to analyze the interplay between social media and news.

        [2] COVID-19 Project: 
    </h3>
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em">
    Project uses surveys, news article text, topic modeling, and link sharing network analysis using Python and Gephi. Analyzed partisan differences in coordinated news link-sharing behavior, linguistic nuances of coverage, and the effect of news consumption on human behavior. Results show that while topics of articles produced by publications are similar, articles including conspiracy theories and outrageous content get more shares and generate disproportionately more engagement on social media. Latest paper uses a user experiment, public Facebook content from CrowdTangle API and interaction data to predict behavioral impacts of vaccine messaging.

        [3] Election, Debate and Misinformation: 
    </h3>
</p>
     <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em">
    Project studies political mobilization, public opinion formation, and (mis)information sharing on multiple social media platforms surrounding the 2020 elections results using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and SNA.

     <h3>
        [4] Reproductive Rights: 
    </h3>
</p>
     <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em">
    The project examines the female reproductive rights discourse using a unique analytical framework that amalgamates NLP, topic modeling with rhetorical analysis, care theory, and rights discourse to interpret the observations. Results show a denser network and a greater usage of care and acknowledgement-based discourse in the pro-life movement in sharp contrast to the sparser network, rampant hashjacking, and rights and justice based-language in the pro-choice movement. Further, the prolife movement had more citizen accounts central to the networks as compared to advocacy groups for the pro-choice movement.

     <h3>[5] Racial Justice Movements: 
    </h3>
</p>
     <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em">
    This interdisciplinary research team, including data scientists working in the industry, researchers from the University of Michigan, Washington State University, University of Minnesota, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, analyzes the ongoing racial justice movements in the USA. Preliminary results show the impact of political polarization on news sharing behavior. In addition, the highly asymmetric media link sharing ecosystem shows greater engagement with articles that produced outrage.

         <h3>[6] UNDP/UN Women COVID-19 Global Gender Response Tracker Project: </h3>
</p>
     <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em">
    In collaboration with the Gender Inequality Research Lab at the University of Pittsburgh, this project monitors data on policy measures enacted by governments worldwide to tackle the COVID-19 crisis, and highlights responses that have integrated a gender lens. I am currently working on analyzing the usage of social media in communicating and framing the policies and their impact on shaping digital public opinion on key COVID-19 topics.

      <h3>[7] NSF Convergence Accelerator Grant Project:
</h3>
</p>
     <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em">
This interdisciplinary team from Wisconsin, Georgia Tech, and Washington State work on detecting the networks, actors and content behind COVID-19 Vaccine and Election Fraud misinformation using computational analysis. Using experiments, the team tests treatments to best address misinformation and disinformation patterns on social media. The team plans to use the insights attained from the experiments to test strategies in social media systems to counter misleading and untruthful content.
