        I’m a data-driven researcher and analyst with over 7 years of diverse experience employing statistical techniques, data manipulation, multiple quantitative and qualitative methods and an array of programming languages to derive key insights. Utilizing my innovative thinking skills, I develop novel methodologies that drive research projects from start to finish.
